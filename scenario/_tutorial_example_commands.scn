# Example scenario

00:00:00.00>CRE KL204,B744,52,4,90,FL250,350

# Create a B747-400 with call sign KL204
# lat,lon = 52,4   (positions can also be clicked with mouse)
# hdg = 90 degrees, so flying east, headings can also be clicked by mouse
# alt = FL250 (so 25000 ft above ISA sea level pressure)
# speed = 350 (kts, CAS), Mach can also be use deg.g 0.84 or M.84 or M84

# Define a route  
00:00:00.00>KL204 ORIG eham
00:00:00.00>KL204 DEST ehgg

# Edit flight plan: call sign ADDWPT wptname, [alt], [spd]
# Waypoint are added at the end of the route before destination

00:00:00.00>KL204 addwpt SPL,fl250
00:00:00.00>KL204 addwpt RTM,,350

# Insert a waypoint
00:00:00.00>KL204 after spl addwpt SSB

00:00:00.00>KL204 LNAV ON;KL204 VNAV ON

# Double click shows rotue via POS command
# POS command can also be used for info on navaids and airports
00:00:00.00>POS KL204

# List route shows route
00:00:00.00>LISTRTE KL204

# When only a destination is entered it is still a route, and LNAV,VNAV is activated
