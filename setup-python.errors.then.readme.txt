Windows 10 users:
If you get errors installing pyopengl-accelerate, this is due to a problem
with Microsofts Build tools and Python 3.7.
Hopefully this will soon be fixed by the pyopengl-accelerate developer.
You could step back to Python 3.6 (to use pyopengl-accelerate)
or run BlueSky with Python 3.7 (without pyopengl-accelerate).
